1. Network traffic analysis with tcpdump

 1.1 How many packets does the trace contain?
     Answer: 32616
     Command used: tcpdump -n -r hw1.pcap | wc -l
 
 1.2 How many ARP packets and how many UDP packets?
     Part1: How many ARP packets?
          Answer: 11304
          Command Used: tcpdump -n -r hw1.pcap arp|wc -l
     Part2: How many UDP packets?
          Answer: 18334
          Command Used: tcpdump -n -r hw1.pcap udp| wc -l

 1.3 How many DHCP packets?
     Answer: 256
     Command Used: tcpdump -r hw1.pcap -n 'udp and (port 67 or port 68)' | wc -l
 
 1.4 How many packets were exchanged between 91.189.90.41 and 192.168.0.200?
     Answer: 14
     Command Used1: tcpdump -n -r hw1.pcap "(ip src 91.189.90.41 or ip src 192.168.0.200) and (ip dst 192.168.0.200 or ip dst 91.189.90.41)" | wc -l
     Command Used2: tcpdump -n "(ip src 192.168.0.200 and ip dst 91.189.90.41) or (ip src 91.189.90.41 and ip dst 192.168.0.200)" -r hw1.pcap | wc -l
 
 1.5 Print the unique source IP addresses found in the trace in numerical
     order.

 1.6 Print the unique 'private network' (according to RFC1918) source IP
     addresses found in the trace in numerical order.
 
 1.7 Print the unique destination IP addresses found in the trace in numerical
     order.
 
 1.8 What are the top-5 TCP and top-5 UDP destination ports?
 
 1.9 How many TCP packets have the SYN flag set?

1.10 How many TCP connection attempts were made?
 
1.11 Towards which ports were TCP connection attempts made? How many attempts
     per port?
 
1.12 How many HTTP GET requests were made? Print the URLs of all HTTP requests
     for JPG files.

1.13 When (date and time) was the first and last packet of the trace sent?

1.14 What is the brand of the device that sent most of the packets? What is its
     IP address?

1.15 Report the distribution of Ethernet packet sizes (how many packets of size
     X exist in the trace, for all values of X in the trace), numerically
     sorted by packet size.


2. What to submit

An plain ASCII text file with the answers to the above questions, along with
the command/script/approach used to find them.
